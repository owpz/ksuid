# âš¡ Performance Improvement

## Performance Problem

**What was slow/inefficient?** Clear description of the performance issue.

**How was it identified?**

- [ ] Profiling
- [ ] Benchmarking
- [ ] User reports
- [ ] Code review

## Solution

**What optimization was made?**

- **How does this improve performance?**

- **What's the trade-off?**

- Code complexity:
- Memory usage:
- Maintainability:

## Benchmarks

**Before optimization:**

```
Generation:     X KSUIDs/sec
Parsing:        X parses/sec
Next/Prev ops:  X ops/sec
Memory usage:   X MB
```

**After optimization:**

```
Generation:     X KSUIDs/sec  (+X%)
Parsing:        X parses/sec   (+X%)
Next/Prev ops:  X ops/sec     (+X%)
Memory usage:   X MB          (+/-X%)
```

**Benchmark methodology:**

```bash
# Commands used to benchmark
npm run benchmark
```

## Go Compatibility

- [ ] Behavior remains identical to Go implementation
- [ ] Performance characteristics similar to Go
- [ ] No changes to public API
- [ ] Cross-validation tests pass

## Testing

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Added performance regression tests
- [ ] Verified correctness under load
- [ ] Memory leak testing (if applicable)

**Test evidence:**

```bash
# Show test results
npm test
```

## Code Quality

- [ ] Code remains readable
- [ ] No increase in complexity
- [ ] Proper comments added for optimizations
- [ ] No magic numbers or unclear optimizations
