# ðŸ”„ Go Compatibility Update

## Compatibility Issue

**What compatibility problem was addressed?** Clear description of the issue with Go
interoperability.

**How was it discovered?**

- [ ] Cross-validation tests failed
- [ ] User reported incompatibility
- [ ] Go library update
- [ ] New test vectors

## Changes Made

**What was modified to fix compatibility?**

- **Go reference used:**

- Repository: `segmentio/ksuid`
- Commit: `commit-hash`
- Files: `file1.go`, `file2.go`

## Validation Results

**Cross-validation test results:**

```bash
cd docs/validation
./cross-validate.sh

# Paste results here
```

**Test vector updates:**

- [ ] Generated new test vectors from Go
- [ ] Updated existing test vectors
- [ ] Added edge case test vectors
- [ ] Verified all vectors pass in both implementations

## Compatibility Matrix

| Feature         | Go Result | TypeScript Result | Status |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| String encoding | `result1` | `result1`         | âœ…     |
| Binary format   | `bytes1`  | `bytes1`          | âœ…     |
| Next/Prev ops   | `result2` | `result2`         | âœ…     |
| CLI output      | `output1` | `output1`         | âœ…     |

## Test Evidence

**Before fix:**

```bash
# Show failing cross-validation
npm test -- src/go-compatibility.test.ts
# X/Y tests passing
```

**After fix:**

```bash
# Show all tests passing
npm test -- src/go-compatibility.test.ts
# Y/Y tests passing (100%)
```

## Go Version Compatibility
